### Description
---
* This application is a campus navigation application that allows a user to log-in, view the map of the campus to select one of the available
buildings available, and browse the available floorplan maps for the buildings. 

* Specifically, the system handles multiple users as well as 
developer accounts (which are allowed to edit POIs in the application). It allows users to interact with the floor-plan maps, specifically
by creating POIs, disabling / enabling layers of POIs, favouriting POIs, scrolling the map, browsing different floors, and viewing the weather.
User information (passwords) are encrypted for the safety of users of this application.
